archimedes:
  name: Archimedes
  birth: c. 287
  death: c. 212 BC
  bio: |
    Archimedes was an ancient Greek scientist and engineer, and one of the
    greatest mathematicians of all time. He discovered many concepts of
    calculus, and worked in geometry, analysis and mechanics.

    While taking a bath, Archimedes discovered a way to determine the volume of
    irregular objects using the amount of water they displaced when submerged.
    He was so excited by this discovery that he run out on the street, still
    undressed, yelling _“Eureka!”_ (Greek for _“I have found it!”_).

    As engineer he built ingenious defence machines during the siege of his home
    city Syracuse in Sicily. After two years, the Romans finally managed to
    enter and Archimedes as killed. His last words were _“Do not disturb my
    circles”_ – which he was studying at the time.
