term: TODO

variable: A __variable__ is an unknown quantity in an algebraic expression,
  which is usually represented by a letter like _x_.

coefficient: A __coefficient__ is the number by which a variable or a power of a
  variable is multiplied. For exmple, the coefficient of `5x^2` is 5, and the
  coefficient of `7y` is 7.

polynomial: A __polynomial__ is an algebraic expression that consists of
  multiple powers of a variable, for example `5x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 4`.

degree: The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of any variables in it.
  For example, the degree of `5x^3 + 2x - 4` is 3.

  into two congruent, smaller angles.

midpoint: The midpoint of a line segment is the point on the line segment that
  splits the segment in the middle, into two congruent parts. The midpoint
