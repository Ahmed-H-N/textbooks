## Getting Started

After forking and cloning this repository, install all dependencies using
`npm install`.

Now you can run a local development server using `npm start`. As you make
changes, the server will automatically watch for file changes and update.
The completed courses can be seen at
[localhost:5000/course/<course_name>](http://localhost:5000/course/probability).

Feel free to send us pull requests with corrections, improvements or additional
content. If you have ideas for new chapters, please
[email us](mailto:dev@mathigon.org) before starting your work.

Our chapters are written in a custom _Markdown_ format. Documentation about
this and other parts of the code can be found in the
[Wiki](https://github.com/mathigon/textbooks/wiki), which we are still working
to improve and expand.
