## Congruent Triangles

Reflection, rotation, translation and scaling
Congruence and similarity
Requirements for triangle congruence
Combinations and invariance of transformations
Symmetry and groups

Two figures are congruent if and only if they have exactly the same size and
shape. If two triangles are congruent, they will have exactly the same three
sides and exactly the same three angles. In other words, two triangles are
congruent if you can turn, flip, and/or slide one so it fits exactly on the
other.

Notice that when two triangles are congruent their three pairs of corresponding
angles and their three pairs of corresponding sides are congruent.

When referring to corresponding congruent parts of congruent triangles, you can
use the phrase Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent, or its
abbreviation CPCTC.


## Properties of Congruence

Reflexive Property of Congruence: Any shape is congruent to itself.
`bar(AB) ~= bar(AB)` or `△ABC ~= △ABC`

Symmetric Property of Congruence: If two shapes are congruent, the statement can
be written with either shape on either side of the `~=` sign.
∠EFG≅∠XYZ and ∠XYZ≅∠EFG or △ABC≅△DEF and △DEF≅△ABC

Transitive Property of Congruence: If two shapes are congruent and one of those
is congruent to a third, the first and third shapes are also congruent.
△ABC≅△DEF and △DEF≅△GHI, then △ABC≅△GHI

These three properties will be very important when you begin to prove that two
triangles are congruent.


## Determining Congruency by the Reflexive Property 

In order to say that `△ABD ~= △ABC`, you must determine that the three
corresponding angles and sides are congruent. Which pair of sides is congruent
by the Reflexive Property?

The side `bar(AB)` is shared by both triangles. So, in a geometric proof,
`bar(AB) ~= bar(AB)` by the Reflexive Property of Congruence.


## Understanding Congruency

If all three pairs of angles for two given triangles are congruent does that
mean that the triangles are congruent?

Without knowing anything about the lengths of the sides you cannot tell whether
or not two triangles are congruent. The two triangles described above might be
congruent, but we would need more information to know for sure.


## Third Angle Theorem

Third Angle Theorem: If two angles in one triangle are congruent to two angles
in another triangle, then the third pair of angles must also congruent.

In other words, for triangles △ABC and △DEF, if ∠A≅∠D and ∠B≅∠E, then ∠C≅∠F.

Notice that this theorem does not state that the triangles are congruent. That
is because if two sets of angles are congruent, the sides could be different
lengths. See the picture below.

The Third Angle Theorem states that if two angles in one triangle are congruent
to two angles in another triangle, then the third pair of angles must also
congruent. What additional information would you need to know in order to be
able to determine that the triangles are congruent?

In order for the triangles to be congruent, you need some information about the
sides. If you know two pairs of angles are congruent and at least one pair of
corresponding sides are congruent, then the triangles will be congruent.

## Similar Polygons and Scale Factors 

Similar polygons are two polygons with the same shape, but not necessarily the
same size. Similar polygons have corresponding angles that are congruent, and
corresponding sides that are proportional.

Think about similar polygons as enlarging or shrinking the same shape. The
symbol ∼ is used to represent similarity. Specific types of triangles,
quadrilaterals, and polygons will always be similar. For example, all
equilateral triangles are similar and all squares are similar. If two polygons
are similar, we know the lengths of corresponding sides are proportional. In
similar polygons, the ratio of one side of a polygon to the corresponding side
of the other is called the scale factor. The ratio of all parts of a polygon 
including the perimeters, diagonals, medians, midsegments, altitudes) is the
same as the ratio of the sides.

Understanding a Similarty Statement 

Suppose △ABC∼△JKL. Based on the similarity statement, which angles are congruent
and which sides are proportional?

Just like in a congruence statement, the congruent angles line up within the
similarity statement. So, ∠A≅∠J,∠B≅∠K, and ∠C≅∠L. Write the sides in a
proportion: ABJK=BCKL=ACJL. Note that the proportion could be written in
different ways. For example, ABBC=JKKL is also true.


## Triangle AA Similarity

The Third Angle Theorem states if two angles are congruent to two angles in
another triangle, the third angles are congruent too. Because a triangle has
180∘, the third angle in any triangle is 180∘ minus the other two angle
measures. Let’s investigate what happens when two different triangles have the
same angle measures.

AA Similarity Postulate: If two angles in one triangle are congruent to two
angles in another triangle, the two triangles are similar.

The AA Similarity Postulate is a shortcut for showing that two triangles are
similar. If you know that two angles in one triangle are congruent to two angles
in another, which is now enough information to show that the two triangles are
similar. Then, you can use the similarity to find the lengths of the sides.


## Indirect Measurement 

An application of similar triangles is to measure lengths indirectly. The length
to be measured would be some feature that was not easily accessible to a person,
such as the width of a river or canyon and the height of a tall object. To
measure something indirectly, you need to set up a pair of similar triangles.

1. A tree outside Ellie’s building casts a 125 foot shadow. At the same time of
day, Ellie casts a 5.5 foot shadow. If Ellie is 4 feet 10 inches tall, how tall
is the tree? Draw a picture. From the picture to the right, we see that the
tree and Ellie are parallel, therefore the two triangles are similar to each
other. Write a proportion.


## Similarity on Rays

When an angle within a triangle is bisected, the bisector divides the triangle
proportionally

By definition, AC−→− divides ∠BAD equally, so ∠BAC≅∠CAD. The proportional
relationship is BCCD=ABAD.

Theorem: If a ray bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite
side into segments that are proportional to the lengths of the other two sides.


The Triangle Proportionality Theorem states that if a line parallel to one side
of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides
proportionally. We can extend this theorem to a situation outside of triangles
where we have multiple parallel lines cut by transverals.

Theorem: If three or more parallel lines are cut by two transversals, then they
divide the transversals proportionally.

Think about a midsegment of a triangle. A midsegment is parallel to one side of
a triangle and divides the other two sides into congruent halves. The midsegment
divides those two sides proportionally.

Triangle Proportionality Theorem: If a line parallel to one side of a triangle
intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally.

Triangle Proportionality Theorem Converse: If a line divides two sides of a
triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side.



## Self Similarity

When one part of an object can be enlarged (or shrunk) to look like the whole
object it is self-similar.

To explore self-similarity, we will go through some examples. Typically, each
step of a process is called an iteration. The first level is called Stage 0.

Sierpinksi Triangle
The Sierpinski triangle iterates a triangle by connecting the midpoints of the
sides and shading the central triangle (Stage 1). Repeat this process for the
unshaded triangles in Stage 1 to get Stage 2.

Fractals
Like the Sierpinski triangle, a fractal is another self-similar object that is
repeated at smaller scales. Below are the first three stages of the Koch
snowflake.

The Cantor Set 
The Cantor set is another example of a fractal. It consists of dividing a
segment into thirds and then erasing the middle third.

## Reflection Symmetry

A line of symmetry is a line that passes through a figure such that it splits
the figure into two congruent halves. Many figures have a line of symmetry, but
some do not have any lines of symmetry. Figures can also have more than one line
of symmetry. A shape has reflection symmetry when it has one or more lines of
symmetry.

### Finding Lines of Symmetry 
Find all lines of symmetry for the shape below.

### Recognizing Reflection Symmetry 
Does the figure below have reflection symmetry?



## Rotation Symmetry

A figure exhibits rotational symmetry if it can be rotated (less than 360) and
look the same as it did before the rotation. The center of rotation is the point
that the figure is rotated around such that the rotational symmetry holds.
Typically, the center of rotation is the center of the figure. Along with
rotational symmetry and a center of rotation is the angle of rotation that tells
us how many degrees to rotate the figure so that it still looks the same. In
general, if a shape can be rotated n times, the angle of rotation is 360° n.
Multiply the angle of rotation by 1, 2, 3...n to find the additional angles of
rotation. The number of rotations may be referred to as the order.

### Recognizing Rotational Symmetry
Determine if the figure below has rotational symmetry. Find the angle of
rotational symmetry and the order.

A regular pentagon can be rotated 5 times to demonstrate rotational symmetry, so
it is order 5. Because there are 5 lines of rotational symmetry, the angle would
be 360∘5=72∘.



## Translations

A transformation is an operation that moves, flips, or changes a figure to
create a new figure. A rigid transformation is a transformation that preserves
size and shape. The rigid transformations are: translations (discussed here),
reflections, and rotations. The new figure created by a transformation is called
the image. The original figure is called the preimage. Another word for a rigid
transformation is an isometry. Rigid transformations are also called congruence
transformations. If the preimage is A, then the image would be labeled A′, said
“a prime.” If there is an image of A′, that would be labeled A′′, said “a double
prime.”

A translation is a transformation that moves every point in a figure the same
distance in the same direction. In the coordinate plane, we say that a
translation moves a figure x units and y units. Another way to write a
translation rule is to use vectors. A vector is a quantity that has direction
and size.

In the graph below, the line from A to B, or the distance traveled, is the
vector. This vector would be labeled AB⇀ because A is the initial point and B
is the terminal point. The terminal point always has the arrow pointing towards
it and has the half-arrow over it in the label.

The component form of AB⇀ combines the horizontal distance traveled and the
vertical distance traveled. We write the component form of AB⇀ as ⟨3,7⟩ because
AB⇀ travels 3 units to the right and 7 units up. Notice the brackets are
pointed, ⟨3,7⟩, not curved.



## Transformations


## Rotation

A transformation is an operation that moves, flips, or changes a figure to
create a new figure. A rigid transformation is a transformation that preserves
size and shape. The rigid transformations are: translations, reflections, and
rotations (discussed here). The new figure created by a transformation is called
the image. The original figure is called the preimage. Another word for a rigid
transformation is an isometry. Rigid transformations are also called congruence
transformations. If the preimage is A, then the image would be labeled A′, said
“a prime.” If there is an image of A′, that would be labeled A′′, said “a double
prime.”

A rotation is a transformation by which a figure is turned around a fixed point
to create an image. The center of rotation is the fixed point that a figure is
rotated around. Lines can be drawn from the preimage to the center of rotation,
and from the center of rotation to the image. The angle formed by these lines
is the angle of rotation.

In this Lesson, our center of rotation will always be the origin. Rotations can
also be clockwise or counterclockwise. We will only do counterclockwise
rotations, to go along with the way the quadrants are numbered.

Investigation: Drawing a Rotation of 100∘
Tools Needed: pencil, paper, protractor, ruler
Draw △ABC and a point R outside the circle. 
Draw the line segment RB. 
Take your protractor, place the center on R and the initial side on RB. Mark a 100∘ angle. 
Find B′ such that RB=RB′.
Repeat steps 2-4 with points A and C.
Connect A′,B′, and C′ to form △A′B′C′.

This is the process you would follow to rotate any figure 100∘ counterclockwise.
If it was a different angle measure, then in Step 3, you would mark a different
angle. You will need to repeat steps 2-4 for every vertex of the shape.

## Reflection

A transformation is an operation that moves, flips, or changes a figure to
create a new figure. A rigid transformation is a transformation that preserves
size and shape. The rigid transformations are: translations, reflections
(discussed here), and rotations. The new figure created by a transformation is
called the image. The original figure is called the preimage. Another word for
a rigid transformation is an isometry. Rigid transformations are also called
congruence transformations. If the preimage is A, then the image would be
labeled A′, said “a prime.” If there is an image of A′, that would be labeled
A′′, said “a double prime.”

A reflection is a transformation that turns a figure into its mirror image by
flipping it over a line. Another way to describe a reflection is a “flip.” The
line of reflection is the line that a figure is reflected over. If a point is
on the line of reflection then the image is the same as the original point.

## Composition

A transformation is an operation that moves, flips, or otherwise changes a
figure to create a new figure. A rigid transformation (also known as an isometry
or congruence transformation) is a transformation that does not change the size
or shape of a figure. The new figure created by a transformation is called the
image. The original figure is called the preimage.

There are three rigid transformations: translations, reflections, and rotations.
A translation is a transformation that moves every point in a figure the same
distance in the same direction. A rotation is a transformation where a figure
is turned around a fixed point to create an image. A reflection is a
transformation that turns a figure into its mirror image by flipping it over a
line.

A composition of transformations is to perform more than one rigid
transformation on a figure. One of the interesting things about compositions is
that they can always be written as one rule. What this means is you don’t
necessarily have to perform one transformation followed by the next. You can
write a rule and perform them at the same time. You can compose any
transformations, but here are some of the most common compositions.

1. Glide Reflection: a composition of a reflection and a translation. The
   translation is in a direction parallel to the line of reflection.

2. Reflections over Parallel Lines Theorem: If you compose two reflections over
   parallel lines that are h units apart, it is the same as a single translation
   of 2h units. Be careful with this theorem. Notice, it does not say which
   direction the translation is in. So, to apply this theorem, you would still
   need to visualize, or even do, the reflections to see in which direction the
   translation would be.
   
3. Reflection over the Axes Theorem: If you compose two reflections over each
   axis, then the final image is a rotation of 180∘ of the original. With this
   particular composition, order does not matter. Let’s look at the angle of
   intersection for these lines. We know that the axes are perpendicular, which
   means they intersect at a 90∘ angle. The final answer was a rotation of 180∘,
   which is double 90∘. Therefore, we could say that the composition of the
   reflections over each axis is a rotation of double their angle of
   intersection.
   
4. Reflection over Intersecting Lines Theorem: If you compose two reflections
   over lines that intersect at x∘, then the resulting image is a rotation of
   2x∘, where the center of rotation is the point of intersection. 


## Dilation

A transformation is an operation that moves, flips, or changes a figure to
create a new figure. Transformations that preserve size are rigid and ones that
do not are non-rigid. A dilation makes a figure larger or smaller, but has the
same shape as the original. In other words, the dilation is similar to the
original. All dilations have a center and a scale factor. The center is the
point of reference for the dilation (like the vanishing point in a perspective
drawing) and scale factor tells us how much the figure stretches or shrinks. A
scale factor is typically labeled k and is always greater than zero. Also, if
the original figure is labeled △ABC, for example, the dilation would be △A'B'C'.
The ' indicates that it is a copy. This tic mark is said “prime,” so A' is read
“A prime.” A second dilation would be A'', read “A double-prime.”

If the dilated image is smaller than the original, then the scale factor is 0 < k < 1.
If the dilated image is larger than the original, then the scale factor is k > 1.

Dilating a Point
1. The center of dilation is P and the scale factor is 3. Find Q'.

If the scale factor is 3 and Q is 6 units away from P, then Q′ is going to be
6×3=18 units away from P. Because we are only dilating a point, the dilation
will be collinear with the original and center.

2. Using the picture above, change the scale factor to 13. Find Q''.

Now the scale factor is 13, so Q'' is going to be 13 the distance away from P
as Q is. In other words, Q'' is going to be 6×13=2 units away from P. Q'' will
also be collinear with Q and center.

## Tessellation

You have probably seen tessellations before, even though you did not call them
that. Examples of tessellations are: a tile floor, a brick or block wall, a
checker or chess board, and a fabric pattern. A tessellation is a tiling over a
plane with one or more figures such that the figures fill the plane with no
overlaps and no gaps. Here are a few examples.

Notice the hexagon (cubes, first tessellation) and the quadrilaterals fit
together perfectly. If we keep adding more, they will entirely cover the plane
with no gaps or overlaps. The tessellation pattern could be colored creatively
to make interesting and/or attractive patterns. To tessellate a shape it must be
able to exactly surround a point, or the sum of the angles around each point in
a tessellation must be 360∘. Therefore, every quadrilateral and hexagon will
tessellate. For a shape to be tessellated, the angles around every point must
add up to 360∘. A regular pentagon does not tessellate by itself. But, if we
add in another shape, a rhombus, for example, then the two shapes together
will tessellate.

Tessellations can also be much more complicated. Here are a couple of examples.
