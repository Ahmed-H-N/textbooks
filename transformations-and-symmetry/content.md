## Introduction

Many geometric concepts, like lines and points, were "invented" by
mathematicians. Symmetry, on the other hand, is everywhere around us in nature.
Almost all plants, animals, and even we humans are symmetric.

{.todo} Symmetry in nature

Over time, we've imitated nature's symmetry in art, architecture, technology
and design. It just seems to look _more beautiful_ than other shapes.

{.todo} Symmetry in art and design

Symmetry even lies at the foundation of important concepts in Physics, like the
conservation of energy: you can change energy from different froms into others
(e.g. electricity into light), but you can never _create_ or _destroy_ energy.

Properties of different kinds of symmetry can be described using mathematics,
and that's what we'll try to do in this chapter.




## Transformations

In order to understand symmetry, we first have to think about transformations.
A transformation is basically a specific set of rules that convert one geometric
figure into another one. Here are a few examples:

{.todo} examples: rigid and non-rigid

In this section we will only think about transformations that don't change the
original figure's size and shape. Imagine it is made out of a solid material
like wood or metal: we can move, turn or flip it, but we can't stretch or
otherwise deform it. These transformations are called rigid transformations
or isometries.

The result of a transformation is called the [image](gloss:transform-image).
The image of a figure `A` is usually denoted by `A'`, pronounced as "A prime".
For rigid transformations, the result is always congruent to the original.

There are three different kinds of rigid transformations

### Translation

A translation is a transformation that moves every point in a figure the same
distance in the same direction. In the coordinate plane, we say that a
translation moves a figure x units and y units. Another way to write a
translation rule is to use vectors. A vector is a quantity that has direction
and size.

In the graph below, the line from A to B, or the distance traveled, is the
vector. This vector would be labeled AB⇀ because A is the initial point and B
is the terminal point. The terminal point always has the arrow pointing towards
it and has the half-arrow over it in the label.

The component form of AB⇀ combines the horizontal distance traveled and the
vertical distance traveled. We write the component form of AB⇀ as ⟨3,7⟩ because
AB⇀ travels 3 units to the right and 7 units up. Notice the brackets are
pointed, ⟨3,7⟩, not curved.

### Reflections

A reflection is a transformation that turns a figure into its mirror image by
flipping it over a line. Another way to describe a reflection is a “flip.” The
line of reflection is the line that a figure is reflected over. If a point is
on the line of reflection then the image is the same as the original point.

---

### Rotation

A transformation is an operation that moves, flips, or changes a figure to
create a new figure. A rigid transformation is a transformation that preserves
size and shape. The rigid transformations are: translations, reflections, and
rotations (discussed here). The new figure created by a transformation is called
the image. The original figure is called the preimage. Another word for a rigid
transformation is an isometry. Rigid transformations are also called congruence
transformations. If the preimage is A, then the image would be labeled A′, said
“a prime.” If there is an image of A′, that would be labeled A′′, said “a double
prime.”

A rotation is a transformation by which a figure is turned around a fixed point
to create an image. The center of rotation is the fixed point that a figure is
rotated around. Lines can be drawn from the preimage to the center of rotation,
and from the center of rotation to the image. The angle formed by these lines
is the angle of rotation.

In this Lesson, our center of rotation will always be the origin. Rotations can
also be clockwise or counterclockwise. We will only do counterclockwise
rotations, to go along with the way the quadrants are numbered.

Investigation: Drawing a Rotation of 100∘
Tools Needed: pencil, paper, protractor, ruler
Draw △ABC and a point R outside the circle. 
Draw the line segment RB. 
Take your protractor, place the center on R and the initial side on RB. Mark a 100∘ angle. 
Find B′ such that RB=RB′.
Repeat steps 2-4 with points A and C.
Connect A′,B′, and C′ to form △A′B′C′.

This is the process you would follow to rotate any figure 100∘ counterclockwise.
If it was a different angle measure, then in Step 3, you would mark a different
angle. You will need to repeat steps 2-4 for every vertex of the shape.

### Composition of Transformations

A transformation is an operation that moves, flips, or otherwise changes a
figure to create a new figure. A rigid transformation (also known as an isometry
or congruence transformation) is a transformation that does not change the size
or shape of a figure. The new figure created by a transformation is called the
image. The original figure is called the preimage.

There are three rigid transformations: translations, reflections, and rotations.
A translation is a transformation that moves every point in a figure the same
distance in the same direction. A rotation is a transformation where a figure
is turned around a fixed point to create an image. A reflection is a
transformation that turns a figure into its mirror image by flipping it over a
line.

A composition of transformations is to perform more than one rigid
transformation on a figure. One of the interesting things about compositions is
that they can always be written as one rule. What this means is you don’t
necessarily have to perform one transformation followed by the next. You can
write a rule and perform them at the same time. You can compose any
transformations, but here are some of the most common compositions.

1. Glide Reflection: a composition of a reflection and a translation. The
   translation is in a direction parallel to the line of reflection.

2. Reflections over Parallel Lines Theorem: If you compose two reflections over
   parallel lines that are h units apart, it is the same as a single translation
   of 2h units. Be careful with this theorem. Notice, it does not say which
   direction the translation is in. So, to apply this theorem, you would still
   need to visualize, or even do, the reflections to see in which direction the
   translation would be.
   
3. Reflection over the Axes Theorem: If you compose two reflections over each
   axis, then the final image is a rotation of 180∘ of the original. With this
   particular composition, order does not matter. Let’s look at the angle of
   intersection for these lines. We know that the axes are perpendicular, which
   means they intersect at a 90∘ angle. The final answer was a rotation of 180∘,
   which is double 90∘. Therefore, we could say that the composition of the
   reflections over each axis is a rotation of double their angle of
   intersection.
   
4. Reflection over Intersecting Lines Theorem: If you compose two reflections
   over lines that intersect at x∘, then the resulting image is a rotation of
   2x∘, where the center of rotation is the point of intersection.

## Symmetry

__Reflection Symmetry__

A line of symmetry is a line that passes through a figure such that it splits
the figure into two congruent halves. Many figures have a line of symmetry, but
some do not have any lines of symmetry. Figures can also have more than one line
of symmetry. A shape has reflection symmetry when it has one or more lines of
symmetry.

Find all lines of symmetry for the shape below.

Does the figure below have reflection symmetry?

__Rotation Symmetry__

A figure exhibits rotational symmetry if it can be rotated (less than 360) and
look the same as it did before the rotation. The center of rotation is the point
that the figure is rotated around such that the rotational symmetry holds.
Typically, the center of rotation is the center of the figure. Along with
rotational symmetry and a center of rotation is the angle of rotation that tells
us how many degrees to rotate the figure so that it still looks the same. In
general, if a shape can be rotated n times, the angle of rotation is 360° n.
Multiply the angle of rotation by 1, 2, 3...n to find the additional angles of
rotation. The number of rotations may be referred to as the order.

Determine if the figure below has rotational symmetry. Find the angle of
rotational symmetry and the order.

A regular pentagon can be rotated 5 times to demonstrate rotational symmetry, so
it is order 5. Because there are 5 lines of rotational symmetry, the angle would
be 360∘5=72∘.

## Symmetry Groups

Let us consider the square as a simple example. To recognise different configurations, we need to highlight the four corners in different colours. Here is a list of all possible rotations and reflections:

identity	90 degrees	180 degrees	270 degrees
do nothing	rotate by 90°	rotate by 180°	rotate by 270°
reflection1	reflection2	reflection3	reflection4
reflect horizontally	reflect diagonally (1)	reflect vertically	reflect diagonally (2)

This collection of symmetries of a square has very special properties. In many ways, the symmetries behave like numbers: we can add symmetries by applying one first and then the other. We can subtract a symmetry by applying its opposite. And there is a ‘0’ value, called the identity: doing nothing.

reflection1 + 90 degrees  =  reflection2	270 degrees – 90 degrees  =  180 degrees
reflection1 + reflection3  =  180 degrees	180 degrees + reflection3  =  reflection1

Note that whenever we add or subtract two rotations or two reflections we get a rotation. But if we add or subtract one reflection and one rotation we get a reflection. This behaviour is very similar to even and odd numbers: adding two even or two odd numbers gives an even number, but adding one odd and one even number gives an odd number.

When adding more than two symmetries, we can use brackets to specify the order. For example, 90 degrees + 90 degrees + reflection1 could mean ( 90 degrees + 90 degrees ) + reflection1, or it could mean 90 degrees + ( 90 degrees + reflection1 ). It is not clear why both ways should give the same result – but if we try it we can see that they do. This not only true for this example but for all possible additions. If a, b and c are any symmetries, then a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c. The property that the order of addition does not matter is called associativity.

It does however matter which way round we add two symmetries – they are not commutative. For example,

There is another interesting property of this set of symmetries: all symmetries can be created by adding just two of them, such as 90 degrees and reflection1. We have

We say that 90 degrees and reflection1 are generators for this collection of symmetries – they can be used to generate all the others.

We can repeat the previous section using triangles or pentagons, or three-dimensional objects like a cube. In each case we would get a similar collection of symmetries, and we would discover that many of their properties are the same. But in mathematics it is often easier to think about one general concept, rather than many different individual cases. We are looking for an overarching idea that describes all these different collections of symmetries at once. This idea is called a Group.

A group, in mathematics, is a collection of “objects” (like symmetries of a cube) together with an operation “∗” (like the addition + of symmetries), which satisfies the following properties:

We have shown that the symmetries of a square form a group, and similarly do the symmetries of any other regular shape. Some groups have more elements, others have fewer, but they always satisfy the four axioms.

The “objects” in the group don’t have to be symmetries, they could be integers … –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, … Whenever we add two integers, we get another integer. It doesn’t matter in which order we add them, so they are associative. The identity is 0, and the inverse of any element is just its negative value. The inverse of 2, for example, would be –2, and the inverse of –10 is 10. Therefore the integers are a group (under addition).

The symmetry groups of polygons all have a finite number of elements, but the group of integers is infinite. There are countless other finite and infinite groups, but their behaviour is very similar.

Groups appear not only when thinking about symmetries or integers, but in many different areas of mathematics. They were first used by the French mathematician Évariste Galois (1811 – 1832) in order to determine whether polynomial equations can be solved. At the age of twenty Galois was shot in a duel, the reason most likely being a love affair. He stayed up all night before his death, writing down some of his ground-breaking mathematical ideas.

In the following years, mathematicians working in many different fields started to use groups: including the geometric groups above and groups of numbers. They had a profound impact on the way we can describe structures and patterns in mathematics, and gave rise to what is called abstract algebra.

Mathematicians started to notice that groups arising in different contexts can behave in very similar ways. Although the elements in the groups may be symmetries in one case and numbers in the other, they behave and interact exactly the same (these groups are called isomorphic). In abstract algebra we therefore think about the structure of groups as a whole, rather than the individual elements.

Since symmetry underlies many effects in nature, group theory is an essential tool in many areas of science, from the symmetries of molecular structures in chemistry to force fields in particle physics.

Every symmetry in nature leads to a particular physical quantity being conserved. “Time” is symmetric and this causes energy to be conserved. “Space” is symmetric and this causes momentum to be conserved. The symmetries of fundamental particles (actually of their associated “fields”) lead to many other quantities and forces being conserved. Understanding the symmetry groups associated with these particles helps physicists understand how our universe works.

__Wallpaper Groups__

You have probably seen tessellations before, even though you did not call them
that. Examples of tessellations are: a tile floor, a brick or block wall, a
checker or chess board, and a fabric pattern. A tessellation is a tiling over a
plane with one or more figures such that the figures fill the plane with no
overlaps and no gaps. Here are a few examples.

Notice the hexagon (cubes, first tessellation) and the quadrilaterals fit
together perfectly. If we keep adding more, they will entirely cover the plane
with no gaps or overlaps. The tessellation pattern could be colored creatively
to make interesting and/or attractive patterns. To tessellate a shape it must be
able to exactly surround a point, or the sum of the angles around each point in
a tessellation must be 360∘. Therefore, every quadrilateral and hexagon will
tessellate. For a shape to be tessellated, the angles around every point must
add up to 360∘. A regular pentagon does not tessellate by itself. But, if we
add in another shape, a rhombus, for example, then the two shapes together
will tessellate.

Tessellations can also be much more complicated. Here are a couple of examples.

A tessellation is a pattern that can cover a flat surface without any gaps or overlaps. Most tessellations are very symmetric: they can have translational, rotational or reflectional symmetries. They can also have a symmetry called glide reflection, a combination of reflection and translation.

These symmetries represent the transformations we can do to a tessellation, so that it looks exactly the same as it did before. They are called the Isometries of the Plane.

All tessellations have a symmetry group, similar to the square we investigated above. These symmetry groups don’t tell you about the pattern that underlies a tessellations, but how the pattern is repeated. Therefore many different tessellations can have the same symmetry group:

It turns out that, among the millions of different patterns and tilings, there are only 17 kinds of symmetry groups a tessellation can have – these are called the Wallpaper Groups. There is no intuitive reason why there are exactly seventeen wallpaper groups, or why any tessellation must have one of those 17 symmetries. Proving it requires more advanced group theory.

Every wallpaper group is defined by a combination of translations, rotations, reflections and glide reflections. Try to find the points of rotation and axes of reflection in the 17 examples below.

Just like we listed all possible symmetry groups of two-dimensional space above, we could list all symmetry groups of three-dimensional space. These are called crystallographic groups and are defined by symmetries of three-dimensional space: translations, glide planes and screw axes (think about the motion when unscrewing a bottle). There are not only 17 of these groups but a total of 219. We shall not list them here…

__Finite Simple Groups__

We have seen that it is possible to add or multiply elements in a group to make a new element in that group. In fact, it is also possible to multiply and divide entire groups to create new groups. And just like prime numbers can’t be divided, there are certain groups which cannot be divided any further. These are called Simple Groups.

One of the biggest achievements of mathematics research in the second half of the 20th century was to find and classify all simple groups which are finite. Unlike randomly distributed prime numbers, finite simple groups have well-defined structures.

Most finite simple groups fall into certain classes, but there are a few that don’t follow a systematic pattern: the Sporadic Groups. The largest of these sporadic groups wasn’t discovered until 1973: the Monster. It has 808 017 424 794 512 875 886 459 904 961 710 757 005 754 368 000 000 000 elements.

It is very surprising, and maybe even discomforting, that very simple ideas like the four group axioms can create objects so huge and bizarre as the Monster group.

## Similarity

Finally, lets look at an example of a transformation that is non-rigid: a
[__dilation__](gloss:dilation) is a transformation that changes a shape's size
by making it larger or smaller.

In this case, the result of the transformation is no longer congruent to the
original (which was the case for rigid transformations). Instead we say that
the two shapes are [__similar__](gloss:similar): they have the same shape but
not necessarily the same size.

All dilations have a center and a scale factor. The center is the point of
reference for the dilation (like the vanishing point in a perspective drawing)
and scale factor tells us how much the figure stretches or shrinks. A scale
factor is typically labeled k and is always greater than zero.

If the dilated image is smaller than the original, then the scale factor is 0 < k < 1.
If the dilated image is larger than the original, then the scale factor is k > 1.



Similar polygons have corresponding angles that are congruent, and corresponding
sides that are proportional.

Think about similar polygons as enlarging or shrinking the same shape. The
symbol ∼ is used to represent similarity. Specific types of triangles,
quadrilaterals, and polygons will always be similar. For example, all
equilateral triangles are similar and all squares are similar. If two polygons
are similar, we know the lengths of corresponding sides are proportional. In
similar polygons, the ratio of one side of a polygon to the corresponding side
of the other is called the scale factor. The ratio of all parts of a polygon 
including the perimeters, diagonals, medians, midsegments, altitudes) is the
same as the ratio of the sides.

__Understanding a Similarty Statement__

Suppose △ABC∼△JKL. Based on the similarity statement, which angles are congruent
and which sides are proportional?

Just like in a congruence statement, the congruent angles line up within the
similarity statement. So, ∠A≅∠J,∠B≅∠K, and ∠C≅∠L. Write the sides in a
proportion: ABJK=BCKL=ACJL. Note that the proportion could be written in
different ways. For example, ABBC=JKKL is also true.

__Triangle AA Similarity__

The Third Angle Theorem states if two angles are congruent to two angles in
another triangle, the third angles are congruent too. Because a triangle has
180∘, the third angle in any triangle is 180∘ minus the other two angle
measures. Let’s investigate what happens when two different triangles have the
same angle measures.

AA Similarity Postulate: If two angles in one triangle are congruent to two
angles in another triangle, the two triangles are similar.

The AA Similarity Postulate is a shortcut for showing that two triangles are
similar. If you know that two angles in one triangle are congruent to two angles
in another, which is now enough information to show that the two triangles are
similar. Then, you can use the similarity to find the lengths of the sides.

__Indirect Measurement__

An application of similar triangles is to measure lengths indirectly. The length
to be measured would be some feature that was not easily accessible to a person,
such as the width of a river or canyon and the height of a tall object. To
measure something indirectly, you need to set up a pair of similar triangles.

1. A tree outside Ellie’s building casts a 125 foot shadow. At the same time of
day, Ellie casts a 5.5 foot shadow. If Ellie is 4 feet 10 inches tall, how tall
is the tree? Draw a picture. From the picture to the right, we see that the
tree and Ellie are parallel, therefore the two triangles are similar to each
other. Write a proportion.

__Similarity on Rays__

When an angle within a triangle is bisected, the bisector divides the triangle
proportionally

By definition, AC−→− divides ∠BAD equally, so ∠BAC≅∠CAD. The proportional
relationship is BCCD=ABAD.

Theorem: If a ray bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite
side into segments that are proportional to the lengths of the other two sides.


The Triangle Proportionality Theorem states that if a line parallel to one side
of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides
proportionally. We can extend this theorem to a situation outside of triangles
where we have multiple parallel lines cut by transverals.

Theorem: If three or more parallel lines are cut by two transversals, then they
divide the transversals proportionally.

Think about a midsegment of a triangle. A midsegment is parallel to one side of
a triangle and divides the other two sides into congruent halves. The midsegment
divides those two sides proportionally.

Triangle Proportionality Theorem: If a line parallel to one side of a triangle
intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally.

Triangle Proportionality Theorem Converse: If a line divides two sides of a
triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side.

### Self Similarity

There are some curious mathematical shapes that are similar to a smaller part
_of themselves_. An example is the __Sierpinksi Triangle__: the entire triangle
is similar to any one of the smaller triangles it consists on. You could zoom
in and infinitely many smaller and smaller triangles.

Shapes with this property are called __Fractals__. They have some surprising
and truly XXX properties, which you will learn about more in the future.
