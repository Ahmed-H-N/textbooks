## Introduction

Many geometric concepts, like lines and points, were "invented" by
mathematicians. Symmetry, on the other hand, is everywhere around us in nature.
Almost all plants, animals, and even we humans are symmetric.

::: column(width=200)
{.todo} IMAGE
::: column(width=200)
{.todo} IMAGE
::: column(width=200)

Over time, we've imitated nature's symmetry in art, architecture, technology
and design. Symmetric shapes and patterns just seems to look _more beautiful_
than non-symmetric ones.

But symmetry is much more important that simply _looking beautiful_. It lies at
the very foundations of our universe, and can explain the fundamental laws of
nature.

Symmetry is a very intuitive concept, but describing it mathematically is more
difficult than you might think. To start with, we have to learn about
_transformations_.

---

## Transformations

A [__transformation__](gloss:transformation) is a specific set of rules that
convert one geometric figure into another one. Here are a few examples:

::: column(width=220)
{.todo} EXAMPLE
::: column(width=220)
{.todo} EXAMPLE
::: column(width=220)
{.todo} EXAMPLE
:::

The result of a transformation is called the __image__. The image of a figure
`A` is usually denoted by `A'`, pronounced as "A prime". 

In this section we will just think about transformations that don't change the
original figure's size and shape. Imagine it is made out of a solid material
like wood or metal: we can move, turn or flip it, but we can't stretch or
otherwise deform it. These transformations are called
[__rigid transformations__](gloss:rigid-transformation).

For rigid transformations, the image is always
[[congruent to|the same as|opposite to]] the original.

Select all of these transformations that are rigid:

{.todo} SELECT EXAMPLE

---

There are three different types of rigid transformations:

::: column.grow(width=220)
{.todo} example

{.text-center} A transformation that _moves_ a shape around is called a
__translation__.

::: column.grow(width=220)
{.todo} example

{.text-center} A transformation that _flips_ a shape over is called a
__reflection__.

::: column.grow(width=220)
{.todo} example

{.text-center} A transformation that _spins_ a shape is called a __rotation__.
:::

We can also combine multiple types of transformation to create more complex
ones – for example, first a translation and then a rotation.

But first, let's have a look at each of these transformations in more detail.

---

### Translation

A translation is a transformation that moves every point of a figure the same
distance in the same direction.

In the coordinate plane, we can specify a translation by how far the shape is
moved along the _x_-axis and the _y_-axis. For example, a transformation by
(3, 5) moves a shape by 3 along the _x_-axis and by 5 along the _y_-axis.

{.todo} EXERCISES - find (x,y) for translations

{.todo} EXERCISES - draw translations on grid

---

### Reflections

A reflection is a transformation that “flips” a shape over a line, called the
__line of reflection__, turning it into its mirror image. 

Draw the line of reflection in each of these examples:

::: column(width=220)
{.todo} EXAMPLE - mountain/lake
::: column(width=220)
{.todo} EXAMPLE - straight line
::: column(width=220)
{.todo} EXAMPLE - diagonal line
:::

---

Now it's your turn: draw the reflection of each of these shapes:

::: column(width=220)
{.todo} EXAMPLE
::: column(width=220)
{.todo} EXAMPLE
::: column(width=220)
{.todo} EXAMPLE
:::

---

If a point lies on the line of reflection, its image is
[[the same as|congruent to|smaller than]] the original point.

---

### Rotation

A rotation is a transformation that “turns” a shape around a fixed point, called
the __center of rotation__.

{.todo} In this Lesson, our center of rotation will always be the origin. Rotations can
also be clockwise or counterclockwise. We will only do counterclockwise
rotations, to go along with the way the quadrants are numbered.

{.todo} Investigation: Drawing a Rotation of 100∘
Tools Needed: pencil, paper, protractor, ruler
Draw △ABC and a point R outside the circle. 
Draw the line segment RB. 
Take your protractor, place the center on R and the initial side on RB. Mark a 100∘ angle. 
Find B′ such that RB=RB′.
Repeat steps 2-4 with points A and C.
Connect A′,B′, and C′ to form △A′B′C′.

---

### Composition of Transformations

We can combine translations, reflections and rotations to create more complex
transformations.

{.todo} A composition of transformations is to perform more than one rigid
transformation on a figure. One of the interesting things about compositions is
that they can always be written as one rule. What this means is you don’t
necessarily have to perform one transformation followed by the next. You can
write a rule and perform them at the same time. You can compose any
transformations, but here are some of the most common compositions.

{.todo} Reflections over Parallel Lines Theorem: If you compose two reflections over
parallel lines that are h units apart, it is the same as a single translation
of 2h units. Be careful with this theorem. Notice, it does not say which
direction the translation is in. So, to apply this theorem, you would still
need to visualize, or even do, the reflections to see in which direction the
translation would be.

{.todo} Reflection over Intersecting Lines Theorem: If you compose two reflections
over lines that intersect at x∘, then the resulting image is a rotation of
2x∘, where the center of rotation is the point of intersection. 

---

Transformations are an important concept in many parts of mathematics, not just
geometry. For example, you can transform [_functions_](gloss:function) by
shifting or rotating their [graphs](gloss:function-graph). Other transformations
don't even have a visual representation at all. You'll learn more about these
transformations in future chapters, but for now let's move on to symmetry.

---

## Symmetry

Symmetry is everywhere around us, and an intuitive concept: different parts of
an object look _the same_ in some way. But using transformations, we can give a
much more precise, mathematical representation of what symmetry _really_ means:

{.definition} An object is _symmetric_ if it looks the same, even after applying
a certain transformation.

::: column.grow

    p.todo animation

{.text-center} We can reflect this butterfly, and it looks the same afterwards.
We say that it has __reflectional symmetry__.

::: column.grow

    p.todo animation

{.text-center} We can rotate this flower, and it looks the same afterwards. We
say that it has __rotational symmetry__.
:::

---

### Reflectional Symmetry

{.todo} intro

The line of reflection is called the __axis of symmetry__. It splits the object
into two [[congruent|equal|similar]] halves. Some figures can even have more
than one axis of symmetry. 

{.todo} EXERCISE Draw all axes of symmetry in these shapes:

{.todo} Letters with reflectional symmetry

---

Shapes and images can have reflectional symmetry, but so can numbers, words and
sentences!

For example "25352" and "ANNA" both read the same from back to front. Numbers
or words like this are called __Palindromes__.

{.todo} Can you think of any other palindromes?

---

There are even entire sentences that are palindromes (if we ignore spaces and
punctuation).

{.text-center} Never odd or even.  
A nut for a jar of tuna.
Yo, banana boy!

While coming up with these sentences might be a fun, it turns out that
palindromes do actually have practical importance. Just a few years ago,
scientists discovered that parts of our [DNA](gloss:dna) are palindromic. This
makes that more resilient to mutations or damage – because there is a second
backup copy of every piece.

---

### Rotational Symmetry

{.todo} flower, snowflake

{.todo} A figure exhibits rotational symmetry if it can be rotated (less than 360) and
look the same as it did before the rotation. The center of rotation is the point
that the figure is rotated around such that the rotational symmetry holds.
Typically, the center of rotation is the center of the figure. Along with
rotational symmetry and a center of rotation is the angle of rotation that tells
us how many degrees to rotate the figure so that it still looks the same. In
general, if a shape can be rotated n times, the angle of rotation is 360° / n.
Multiply the angle of rotation by 1, 2, 3...n to find the additional angles of
rotation. The number of rotations may be referred to as the order.

{.todo} Determine if the figure below has rotational symmetry. Find the angle of
rotational symmetry and the order.

{.todo} A regular pentagon can be rotated 5 times to demonstrate rotational symmetry, so
it is order 5. Because there are 5 lines of rotational symmetry, the angle would
be `360° / 5 = 72°`.

---

## Symmetry Groups

{.hint} To recognise different configurations, we need to highlight the four
corners in different colours.

Some shapes have more than one symmetry – let's have a look at the
[square](gloss:square) as a simple example.

::: column(width=400)
{.todo} images

::: column.grow(width=200)
You have already shown above that a square has [[4]] axes of reflection.

{.subsection(needs="blank-0")} It also has rotational symmetry by [[90]]°,
[[180]]° and [[270°]].

{.subsection(needs="blank-1 blank-2 blank-3")} And finally, we can think
about "doing nothing" as another special kind of symmetry – because the result
is (obviously) the same as before. This is sometimes called the _identity_.
:::

In total, we have found 8 different symmetries of the square.

The collection of symmetries has some interesting properties: for example, we
can add two different symmetries, and we get a new one:

{.todo} animated example

{.todo} more on group theory

{.todo} applications: viruses, molecules, etc.

---

## Wallpaper Groups

So far, we have seen two different kinds of symmetry, that correspond to two
different transformations: rotations and reflections. 

But there is also a symmetry for the third kind of transformation,
[[translations|spins|flips]]: __translational symmetry__ does not work for
isolated objects like flowers or butterflies, but for patterns that extend into
every direction:

::: column.grow
{.todo} honeycomb
::: column.grow
{.todo} wallpaper
:::

---

And there even is a fourth kind of symmetry, __glide reflections__, which is a
combination of a translation and a reflection. _The translation is in a direction
parallel to the line of reflection._

::: column.grow(width=220)
{.todo} footsteps
![](https://plus.maths.org/issue38/features/livio/figure5.jpg)
::: column.grow(width=220)
{.todo} wallpaper
:::

---

Just like we did for the square above, we can find the [symmetry group](gloss:symmetry-group)
of a certain pattern, that contains all of its symmetries.

These groups don't tell you anything about what exactly the pattern _looks_
like, just how it is _repeated_. Therefore multiple different patterns can have
the same symmetry group:

{.todo} patterns and symmetry group examples

It turns out that, while there are infinitely many possible patterns, they all
have one of just 17 different symmetry groups. These are called the __Wallpaper
Groups__.

Every wallpaper group is defined by a combination of translations, rotations,
reflections and glide reflections. Try to find the points of rotation and axes
of reflection in the 17 examples below:

{.todo} slideshow

Unfortunately there is no simple reason why the number is _seventeen_, and
proving it requires much more advanced mathematics.

Instead, you can try drawing your own repeated patterns for each of the 17
wallpaper groups:

    include ./components/wallpaper
    x-wallpaper

{.todo} drawings by other students

---

The Wallpaper groups were all about flat, two-dimensional patterns. We can do
something similar for three-dimensional patterns: these are called
crystallographic groups, and there are 219 of them. In addition to translation,
reflection, rotation, and glide reflection, they include symmetries like glide
planes and screw axes (think about the motion when unscrewing a bottle).

## Symmetry in Physics

All of the symmetries we looked at so far were _visual_ in some sense: shapes,
images or patterns we can see. In fact, symmetry can be a much wider concept –
_immunity to change_.

For example, if you like apple juice just as much as you like orange juice, then
your preference is "symmetric" under the transformation that swaps apples and
oranges.

In 1915, the German mathematician Emmy Noether observed that something similar
is true for the [laws of nature](gloss:laws-of-nature).

For example, our experience tells us that the laws of motion are the same
everywhere in the universe. It doesn't matter if you conduct a physics
experiment in London, or in New York, or on Mars – the laws of motion should
always be the same. In a way, they have [[translational symmetry|reflectional symmetry]].

---
> wrap: stars

Similarly, it shouldn't matter if we conduct an experiment while facing North,
or South, or East or West: the laws of nature have [[rotational symmetry|glide reflection symmetry]].

---
> wrap: stars

And finally, it shouldn't matter if we conduct an experiment today, or tomorrow,
or in a year. The laws of nature are "time-symmetric".

These symmetries might all seem meaningless and obvious, but they can actually
tell us a lot about how the corresponding laws of nature must look like. Emmy
Noether managed to prove that every symmetry corresponds to a certain physical
quantity that is _conserved_. One example is Energy: the universe will always
contain the same amount of energy. You cannot create or destroy energy, just
convert it between different types (like Heat or Light).

Just knowing about symmetry allows physicists to derive most of the laws of
nature that govern the entire universe – without ever actually having to do an
experiment.

Symmetry can even predict the existence of fundamental particles. One example is
the famous Higgs Boson. It was predicted in the 1960s by theoretical physicists,
but not discovered experimentally until 2012.

## Similarity

So far, all of the transformations we looked at were [[rigid|congruent|visual]].
Now, lets think about one that is not: a [__dilation__](gloss:dilation) changes
a shape's size by making it larger or smaller.

All dilations have a center and a scale factor. The center is the point of
reference for the dilation and scale factor tells us how much the figure
stretches or shrinks.

::: column.grow
If the scale factor is between 0 and 1, the image is [[smaller|larger]] than the
original. If the scale factor is larger than 1, the image is [[larger|smaller]]
than the original.
::: column(width=300)
{.todo} move the center, slider for scale factor
:::

{.todo} perspective drawing, vanishing point

---

For rigid transformations, the image is always [[congruent|larger|smaller]] than
the original. However this is no longer true for dilations.

::: column.grow
Instead, we say that two shapes are [__similar__](gloss:similar) if they have
the same overall shape, but not necessarily the same size.

The symbol for similarity is "~". (Contrast this with the symbol for congruence,
which was `~=`.) For example, in this image, `A ~ A'`.

### Similar Polygons

{.todo} squares and circles are always similar

{.todo} If two polygons are similar, all of its pairs angles are
[congruent](gloss:congruent-angles).

{.todo} lengths of corresponding sides are proportional: the ratio of one side
of a polygon to the corresponding side of the other is called the scale factor.
The ratio of all parts of a polygon  including the perimeters, diagonals,
medians, midsegments, altitudes) is the same as the ratio of the sides.

{.todo} If △ABC∼△JKL, then the congruent angles line up within the similarity statement.
So, ∠A≅∠J,∠B≅∠K, and ∠C≅∠L. Write the sides in a proportion: ABJK=BCKL=ACJL.

---

### Similar Triangles

{.todo} We know that the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180°. This means
that if we know two angles in a triangle, we can always work out the third one.

{.todo} Let’s investigate what happens when two different triangles have the
same angle measures. If two angles in one triangle are congruent to two
angles in another triangle, the two triangles are similar.

{.todo} This is a shortcut for showing that two triangles are
similar. If you know that two angles in one triangle are congruent to two angles
in another, which is now enough information to show that the two triangles are
similar. Then, you can use the similarity to find the lengths of the sides.

---

We can use this fact to measure very large objects, like the height of a tower,
or the width of a river.

{.todo} A tree outside Ellie’s building casts a 125 foot shadow. At the same time of
day, Ellie casts a 5.5 foot shadow. If Ellie is 4 feet 10 inches tall, how tall
is the tree? Draw a picture. From the picture to the right, we see that the
tree and Ellie are parallel, therefore the two triangles are similar to each
other.

    // __Similarity on Rays__
    // 
    // When an angle within a triangle is bisected, the bisector divides the triangle
    // proportionally
    // 
    // By definition, AC−→− divides ∠BAD equally, so ∠BAC≅∠CAD. The proportional
    // relationship is BCCD=ABAD.
    // 
    // Theorem: If a ray bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite
    // side into segments that are proportional to the lengths of the other two sides.
    // 
    // 
    // The Triangle Proportionality Theorem states that if a line parallel to one side
    // of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides
    // proportionally. We can extend this theorem to a situation outside of triangles
    // where we have multiple parallel lines cut by transverals.
    // 
    // Theorem: If three or more parallel lines are cut by two transversals, then they
    // divide the transversals proportionally.
    // 
    // Think about a midsegment of a triangle. A midsegment is parallel to one side of
    // a triangle and divides the other two sides into congruent halves. The midsegment
    // divides those two sides proportionally.
    // 
    // Triangle Proportionality Theorem: If a line parallel to one side of a triangle
    // intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally.
    // 
    // Triangle Proportionality Theorem Converse: If a line divides two sides of a
    // triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side.


    // ### Self Similarity
    // 
    // There are some curious mathematical shapes that are similar to a smaller part
    // _of themselves_. An example is the __Sierpinksi Triangle__: the entire triangle
    // is similar to any one of the smaller triangles it consists on. You could zoom
    // in and infinitely many smaller and smaller triangles.
    // 
    // Shapes with this property are called __Fractals__. They have some surprising
    // and truly XXX properties, which you will learn about more in the future.
