# Graph Theory

- Graph Scale Parameters
- Bridges of Konigsberg: Graph Drawing Interactive
- Euler Counting
- Euler Proof
- Travelling Salesman
- Subgraphs (It was not immediately clear to me how the graphs were related to one another in the interactive section. Small labels could help or perhaps it would be useful as a matching game. Line the 3 graphs on one side facing the 3 subgraphs and ask the reader to match the subgraph to its graph.)
- The interactive which explains the proof starts with "The simplest graph consists of a single vertex." but shows a picture of a graph with 4 vertices. In fact, the picture of the 4 vertex cycle stays up throughout the entire thing but I think you meant to have the picture match the text at every step. Also, the F, V, E chart does not update with new information as we add vertices. I'm just realizing now that this is probably still under construction.
- This may have been intentional, but the proof really glosses over many details. Reading as someone with a solid math background, I was not satisfied with the proof as it is laid out and I think that someone who is really trying to understand what's going on will also be left feeling duped. Even if it is too complicated to show the entire proof, perhaps there should be a link to an easy-to-read account of the proof? And/or be upfront about how many details are missing so the reader knows there is more to the story. "We have shown that, whichever way we add new vertices, Eulerâ€™s equation is valid. Therefore it is valid for all graphs." But we really only saw a few possible cases and this account does not prove the theorem.
- The rearranging cities interactive does not support adding or removing cities even though the text says it does.
- Animation under construction for Greedy Algorithm and 2-Opt Algorithm?
- Graphic under construction beside ant pheromone paragraph?
- I think this part could be explained in a bit more detail: "Finding a fast and exact algorithm would have serious implications in the field of computer science: it would mean that there are fast algorithms for all NP-hard problems. " ie, why does it imply a fast algorithm for all NP-hard problems and how many NP-hard problems are there?
