## A Troubling Number for our Usual Mathematics

Our number notation is incredibly powerful, and has allowed us to make amazing
discoveries in mathematics, science and engineering.

However, numbers have one important property that we usually take for granted
without thinking about it: all numbers are __unique__. In other words, there are
no two different numbers that are equal. 5 is different from 8, 100 is different
from 101, and so on.

Well – almost. Like for every rule, there might be a few exceptions to this one.
For example, here is one age-old question asked by students around the world:

{.text-center} Is 0.999999… equal to 1 or not?

Note that the "…" means that there are _infinitely many_ 9s to the right of the
decimal point. If the answer to this question is "yes", it would mean that there
are two seemingly completely different numbers, that are actually the same.

What do you think?

---

Of course we'll resolve the question later in this chapter – but if we are
honest, this sounds like a dubious problem to start with. There is no way we
could actually write down infinitely manny 9s: tt would take infinitely long.
We have to cheat and write an ellipsis (dots) to say “imagine this going on
forever.”

This means that the question is actually one for our imagination. It is really
asking:

{.text-center} _If we were somehow God-like and could list an infinite string of
9s to the right of the decimal point, would the quantity that results be equal
to  1, or not?_

One might decide that since we humans are not God-like the question is
meaningless, and so there is no point to even giving the question consideration.

Yet, discoveries and progress always start by asking "what if…", and simply
declaring it as an invalid question seems like a very unsatisfactory solution,

Each approximation we humans write for 0.9999… is close to 1, not equal to 1, in fact, just shy of  1 each time.

0.9 is less than 1.

0.99 is less than 1.

0.99999 is less than 1.

0.999999999999 is less than 1.

0.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 is less than 1.
 
And some people use this to argue that 0.9999… too must be smaller than 1, and so not equal to 1.

But let’s think a little more deeply about these numbers 0.9,  0.99, 0.999, …. They’re are sequence of numbers marching rightward on the number line, heading to the number 0.9999…, which might or might not be 1.

![](http://gdaymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/P1.jpg)

At the same time, we see the more 9s we list after the decimal point, the closer the numbers are to the number 1. For instance, 0.99 is one-hundredth of a unit away from 1, and 0.999999 is one-millionth of a unit away from 1.

So in fact the numbers 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, … steadily march rightward on the number line eventually entering any amount of space you might specify sitting to the left side of 1. (Want a number within a distance of 1337 from 1?  0.9999 will do!)

So could the quantity 0.9999… be a number sitting just shy of the number 1 and not be 1? Could there be any empty space between it and 1?

No! We just argued that the sequence of 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, … will march into any space we specify to the left of 1! Thus we could conclude

There can be no space between  0.9999… and 1 on the number line, and so 0.9999… must actually be 1.

Well … not quite!

There is another possibility to rule out.

Could 0.9999… instead be quantity sitting just to the right of  on the number line?

This feels unlikely since all the numbers 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, … sit to the left of 1 with 1 being an upper barrier to them all.

But if we feel uneasy about a geometric argument, we can always turn to an algebraic one.


### An Algebraic Argument

If you choose to believe that 0.9999… is a valid arithmetical quantity (that might or might not be 1), then you probably would also choose to believe that it obeys all the usual rules of arithmetic. If so, then we can conduct a lovely swift algebra argument so show that, because of these beliefs, the quantity  0.9999… does indeed equal 1. The argument goes as follows.

STEP 1: Give the quantity a name.

We’ll call it F for Fredericka:

F=0.9999….

STEP 2: Multiply by ten

We obtain

10F=9.9999….

STEP 3: Subtract

Notice 10F and F differ only by 9  in the ones place and so 10F–F is 9. That is, we have

9F=9

giving

F=1.

The mathematics thus establishes that  0.9999…=1.

Lovely!

But let me be clear on what we have established here.

IF you choose to believe that 0.9999… is a meaningful quantity in USUAL MATHEMATICS, then you must conclude that it equals 1.

I say this because this algebraic argument can lead to philosophical woes, as we’ll see in the next lesson.

### Final Thought 

Here’s a picture of 0.9999… in a 1←10 machine with decimals.

![](http://gdaymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/p2.jpg)

Place a dot and an antidot in the first box. This doesn’t change the number.

![](http://gdaymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/p3.jpg)

But now we can perform an explosion.

![](http://gdaymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/p4.jpg)

The number in this picture which looks like 1.−1|9|9|9… is still 0.9999….

Now add another dot-antidot pair and perform another explosion. There is now also an annihilation.

![](http://gdaymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/p5.jpg)

Now we have 1.0|−1|9|9… is the same as 0.9999….

And do this again

![](http://gdaymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/p6.jpg)

and again, and again, and again, forever.

It looks like we are actually showing that 0.9999… is the same as 1.0000….

## A Troubling Number our Usual Mathematics Rejects

The number 0.9999…  (if you choose to believe it is a one) has infinitely many 9s to the right of the decimal point. What if we consider the “number” with infinitely many 9s to the left of the decimal point instead?

…9999

This is a number that ends with nine. Actually it ends with ninety-nine. Actually it ends with nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine. And so on.

Let’s apply our algebraic argument to see what value it must have.

STEP 1: Give the quantity a name.

We’ll call it A for Allistaire.

A=…9999.

STEP 2: Multiply by ten

We obtain

10A=…99990.

STEP 3: Subtract

We see that A and 10A differ by nine (it is only their final digits that differ). Looking at A−10A we get

−9A=9
giving

A=−1.

That is, our mathematics establishes that

…9999=−1.

Apparently, if we pulled out a calculator and computed the sum 9+90+900+9000+⋯ the calculator will show at the end of time the answer −1!

Do you believe that?

Putting it another way: On a number line, do you believe that the numbers 9, 99, 999, …. are marching closer and closer to the number −1?

![](http://gdaymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/P1-1.jpg)

Challenge: Let’s make matters worse! Consider the “number” with infinitely many 9s both to the left and to the right of the decimal point: …9999.9999…. Use the same algebraic argument to show that this equals zero. (And this makes sense, because …9999.9999…=…9999+.9999…=−1+1=0.)
 
It is hard to believe that …9999 is a meaningful number and, moreover, it has the value −1, at least in our usual way of think about arithmetic. But remember, all we proved here is that IF we choose to say that …9999 is a meaningful number, then it has value −1.  It is up to us to decide whether or not it is meaningful quantity in the first place. Most people say it is not and stop there and that is fine.

But this begs the question:

Is there an UNUSUAL system of arithmetic for which …9999 is meaningful (for which it has value −1)?


Challenge: One might be able to argue that …9999 does behave like −1 in ordinary arithmetic to some degree. For example, consider performing the (very) long addition shown. Do you see the answer zero results?

If you prefer, imagine what happens if you add one dot to this loaded 1←10 machine.

![](http://gdaymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/p3-1-768x220.jpg)


Challenge: Try this (very) long multiplication problem. Do you see that …66667 is behaving like the fraction 13?

![](http://gdaymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/p4-1.jpg)

If you prefer, imagine what happens if you triple the count of dots in each of these boxes.

Extra: What “number” behaves like 23?
